## Hello World

```
geek@github:~$ sudo useradd -d /home/thinkinginbinary -m thinkinginbinary
geek@github:~$ sudo passwd thinkinginbinary
```

### And then there was light!

Just like a newborn unix system user this page was just born. The plan, on which I'll never stick to, is to collect thoughts, tips and tricks about penetration testing, security and programming. Or not.

I could do this all day but I should probably stop now. Anyways, who am I? A fine mixture of alcohol, nicotine and messy thoughts, I spend most of my time in front of a terminal. I like security and I love challenges so I declared myself a penetration tester.

I also work as a Level 1 SOC analyst in a Cyber Security firm. There will *probably* be more posts regarding my day job. That's right I said day job. By night I'm a vigilante hacker * **cough cough** *. No, just kidding, I just enjoy playing hacking challenges. You can find me on Hack The Box, providing my self-description is accurate enought for you to guess my username.
