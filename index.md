## Hello World

ThinkingInBinary is the personal blog of well, me, Nick Aliferopoulos. I develop malware and offensive tooling for the [Hackcraft](https://hackcraft.gr) Red Team. I spend a lot of my time writing low-level code, reverse engineering, or staring at debugger screens.

You can also find me on [Twitter][https://twitter.com/naliferopoulos] or [Github](https://github.com/naliferopoulos).

Sometimes an interesting observation comes up during research, a rare corner-case is encountered or something entirely different occupies my interest enough for me to write about it. Here is a list of articles in chronological order.
